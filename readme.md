Mechatronics final project - robotic face of an engineering professor

The students had to visit an assigned professor record his/her voice, take a photo and then create a robotic face that incorporated the face, voice. The robotic face had to have two moving parts, one of which was the mouth and the other was left to their choice. There had to be two sensors on board that would allow interaction between the user and the robotics face (e.g., on waving to the animatronics the face would talk).
